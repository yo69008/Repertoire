# Repertoire

Repertoire is a small android application which allows to reproduce the telephone directory.

## Demonstration

  - When you want to search for a contact, simply enter the name it carries in the directory and click on the button "Chercher". If it does not exist in the directory, a pop-up will appear for you to indicate it.

  - When you create a new contact you must fill in the line "Nom" and the line "Tel" and click the button "Enregistrer" (the line "ID" will automatically complete when saving). A pop-up appears to indicate the creation of the contact.

  - Once the contact is in the directory, when you search for it, the "ID", "Name" and "Tel" lines fill with the recorded information.
